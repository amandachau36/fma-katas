// -	This ImageStorage class has _compressor, _filter as its properties. 
// This can be set through the constructor or the method that you need.
// -	ImageStorage class has a method called 'store'. 
// 'store' method gets the filename (do not worry about image type, just pass string as "fileName")
// -	When store method is executed, the logic under the method needs to have "DIFFERENT behavior" based on what compressor 
// is and what filter is. `store` logic is going to be like compress, and then apply filter
//
// Compressor example: jpg, pngâ€¦
// Filter example: blackAndWhite, highContrast
