// Exercise 1: Design a StopwatchDesign a class called Stopwatch. The job of this class is to simulate a stopwatch.
// It should provide two methods: Start and Stop. We call the start method first, and the stop method next. 
// Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration between start and stop. Duration should be a value in TimeSpan. 
// Display the duration on the console. We should also be able to use a stopwatch multiple times. 
// So we may start and stop it and then start and stop it again. Make sure the duration value each time is calculated properly. 
// We should not be able to start a stopwatch twice in a row (because that may overwrite the initial start time). 
// So the class should throw an InvalidOperationException if its started twice. 1
// Educational tip: The aim of this exercise is to make you understand that a class should be always in a valid state. 
// We use encapsulation and information hiding to achieve that. The class should not reveal its implementation detail. 
// It only reveals a little bit, like a blackbox. From the outside, you should not be able to misuse a class because you shouldnâ€™t 
// be able to see the implementation detail.
